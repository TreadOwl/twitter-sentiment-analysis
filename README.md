# Twitter Sentiment Analysis

Sentiment analysis is a technique through which you can analyze a piece of text to determine the sentiment behind it. It combines machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) to achieve this. Using basic Sentiment analysis, a program can understand whether the sentiment behind a piece of text is positive, negative, or neutral.

It is a powerful technique in Artificial intelligence that has important business applications. For example, you can use sentiment analysis to analyze customer feedback. After collecting that feedback through various mediums like Twitter and Facebook, you can run sentiment analysis algorithms on those text snippets to understand your customers' attitude towards your product. 

The main part of sentiment analysis is the subjectivity and Polarity from which we can differentiate between the positive, negative, and neutral tweets.
Subjectivity is a float value that lies in the range of [-1,1]. It describes whether the data is a fact or an opinion. Subjective sentences generally refer to opinion, emotion, or judgment. 

Polarity is a float value that lies in the range of [-1,1] where 1 means a positive statement and -1 means a negative statement. If the value of polarity is less than 0 then the Sentiment of the data is Negative. If the value of polarity is greater than 0 then the Sentiment of the data is Positive. If the value of polarity is equal to 0 then the Sentiment of the data is Neutral.

The field of sentiment analysis is an exciting new research direction due to large number of real-world applications where discovering peopleâ€™s opinion is important in better decision making. The development of techniques for the document-level sentiment analysis is one of the significant components of this area. Recently, people have started expressing their opinions on the Web that increased the need of analyzing the opinionated online content for various real-world applications. A lot of research is present in literature for detecting sentiment from the text. Existing sentiment analysis models can be improved further with more semantic and commonsense knowledge
